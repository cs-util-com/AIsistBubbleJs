# BabyStepsJs

BabyStepsJs is a playful tech-tree web app that helps parents track their baby’s developmental milestones and see what’s next.  
Your progress is **saved locally in your browser's storage**, so you won't lose your data when you refresh the page.  
All functionality works offline once the page is fully loaded.
