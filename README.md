## Development Context

TemplateJs is a foundation for lightweight, self-contained web apps.
It follows an AI-assisted iterative development process:

- User stories and requirements drive feature development.
- Each iteration is a single commit for easy review.
- AI-assisted coding minimizes manual intervention.
- The focus is on defining clear requirements rather than manual coding.

This approach enables rapid prototyping and structured iteration.
