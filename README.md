# TemplateJs

TemplateJs is a minimal single-page web app template designed for quick deployment. 

## Using the Template

1. Fork this repository
2. Open the fork via GitHub CodeSpaces
3. Install VsCode plugins
   - "Live Server" to render the resulting page including live updates while you edit etc
   - "GitHub Copilot" to do smaller iterations inside of CodeSpaces
4. Edit the index.html and regularly commit and push in CodeSpaces to "release" your latest app version

## Development Context

TemplateJs is a foundation for lightweight, self-contained web apps.
It follows an AI-assisted iterative development process:

- User stories and requirements drive feature development.
- Each iteration is a single commit for easy review.
- AI-assisted coding minimizes manual intervention.
- The focus is on defining clear requirements rather than manual coding.

This approach enables rapid prototyping and structured iteration.

## Disclaimer

TemplateJs is provided as-is. It is a general-purpose template and does not include domain-specific functionality. Use and modify as needed.
